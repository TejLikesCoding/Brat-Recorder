# Brat-Recorder
Brat themed music making system in Java

Did this just for fun to learn about GUI work with JFrame and get familiar with some new libraries to do with manipulating labels, frames and sound

You can add instruments to record and loop and play over the main drum beat which can be at a specified tempo
You can play all and stop all instruments and record instruments individually and play them while overlapping
You can add more notes by assigning more keybinds to notes in the code

Known issues:
- Adding the drums doesnt work very well as a separate instrument opposed to the default looped drum beat


Possible ways to scale:
- Add way to record all audio and convert the recording into an audio file
